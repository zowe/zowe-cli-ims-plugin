 --------

   - Start an application program named PGM123:

      $ zowe ims start program \\"PGM123\\"

   - Start all application programs beginning with ACC*:

      $ zowe ims start program \\"ACC*\\"

   - Start an application program named PGM234 and start
   tracing:

      $ zowe ims start program \\"PGM234\\" --attributes \\"SCHD TRACE\\"
