 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   region | reg

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Start an IMS region.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe ims start region [memberName] [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   memberName		 (string)

      The name of the member that contains JCL for the region to start. The maximum
      length of the member name is eight characters. If no member name is specified,
      the default member name is used

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --route | --rte (array)

      The region(s) to route the command to

   --local | -l (boolean)

      If you specify the --local option, IMS overrides the symbolic IMSID parameter in
      the JCL of the default or specified member. --local is the default if you
      specify the --job-name option.

   --job-name | --jn (string)

      Use this option to override the job name on the JOB statement of the default or
      specified JCL member for a dependent region.

 IMS CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ----------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The IMS Operations API server host name.

   --port | -P (number)

      The IMS Operations API server port.

   --ims-connect-host | --ich (string)

      The hostname of your instance of IMS Connect. This is typically the hostname of
      the mainframe LPAR where IMS Connect is running.

   --ims-connect-port | --icp (number)

      The port of your instance of IMS Connect. This port can be found in your IMS
      Connect configuration file on the mainframe.

   --plex | -x (string)

      The name of the IMS plex.

   --user | -u (string)

      The web server user name where the IMS Operations API resides.

   --password | --pass (string)

      The web server user password where the IMS Operations API resides.

   --base-path | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol (string)

      Specifies protocol (http or https).

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --ims-profile | --ims-p (string)

      The name of a (ims) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-examples (boolean)

      Display examples for all the commands in a group

   --help-web | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Start a region stored in a member named MEM1:

      $ zowe ims start region \\"MEM1\\"

   - Start a region stored in a member named MEM2 specifying the
   region to route the command:

      $ zowe ims start region \\"MEM2\\" --route \\"IMS1\\"

   - Start a region stored in a member named MEM3 and override
   the job name:

      $ zowe ims start region \\"MEM3\\" --job-name \\"JOB9\\"

   - Start a region stored in a member named MEM4 routing to
   control regions IMS1 and IMS2:

      $ zowe ims start region \\"MEM4\\" --route \\"IMS1 IMS2\\"

   - Start a region stored in a member named MEM5 specifying
   optional connection parameters:

      $ zowe ims start region \\"MEM5\\" --user \\"username\\" --pass \\"pass1234\\" --host \\"localhost\\" --port 8080 --ich \\"zos1\\" --icp 9999 --plex \\"PLEX1\\"
