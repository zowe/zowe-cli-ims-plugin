 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Update an application program named PGM123 to execute
   exclusively as Fast Path:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"PGM123\\" --fp \\"E\\"

   - Update all application programs beginning with ACC* to not
   run in a BMP type region:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"ACC*\\" --bmptype \\"N\\"

   - Unlock all programs beginning with PGM* to allow
   scheduling:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"PGM*\\" --lock \\"OFF\\"
