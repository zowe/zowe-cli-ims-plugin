 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Update an application program named PGM123 to execute
   exclusively as Fast Path:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"PGM123\\" --fp \\"E\\"

   - Update all application programs beginning with ACC* to not
   run in a BMP type region:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"ACC*\\" --bmptype \\"N\\"

   - Unlock all programs beginning with PGM* to allow
   scheduling:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"PGM*\\" --lock \\"OFF\\"

   - Update an application program named PGM890 to execute as
   Fast Path routing to control regions IMS1 and IMS2:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"PGM890\\" --fp \\"E\\" --route \\"IMS1 IMS2\\"

   - Unlock an application programs named XYZ1 to allow
   scheduling specifying optional connection parameters:

      $ zowe ims update program \\"XYZ1\\" --lock \\"OFF\\" --user \\"username\\" --pass \\"pass1234\\" --host \\"localhost\\" --port 8080 --ich \\"zos1\\" --icp 9999 --plex \\"PLEX1\\"
