   - Unlock to allow scheduling all transactions beginning with
   TRN* and associated with class CLASSA:

      $ zowe ims update transaction \\"TRN*\\" --class \\"CLASSA\\" --lock \\"OFF\\"

   - Set response mode on for transaction named TRN2 and
   associated with classes CLASS1 and CLASS2:

      $ zowe ims update transaction \\"TRN2\\" --class \\"CLASS1 CLASS2\\" --resp \\"Y\\"

   - Update a transaction named TRN3 to process exclusively as
   Fast Path routing to control regions IMS1 and IMS2:

      $ zowe ims update transaction \\"TRN3\\" -fp \\"E\\" --route \\"IMS1 IMS2\\"

   - Associate PGM1 with transaction named TRN4 specifying
   optional connection parameters:
